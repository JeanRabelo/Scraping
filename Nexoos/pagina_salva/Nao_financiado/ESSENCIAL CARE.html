<p style="" class="footer-warning">O Investidor precisa estar ciente de todos os riscos envolvidos. Ao realizar um investimento na Nexoos, o Investidor passa a estar exposto ao risco de perder a totalidade ou parte do investimento realizado, uma vez que seu retorno está vinculado ao pagamento das parcelas do empréstimo por parte da empresa solicitante. O Investidor tem que estar ciente de que existe a possibilidade de ter que tomar medidas extrajudiciais ou judiciais para cobrar a empresa solicitante caso esta se torne inadimplente. Apesar de a Nexoos agregar valor à análise de crédito, a classificação de risco é apenas informativa e recomendamos ao investidor que faça a sua própria investigação, análise e avaliação anteriormente à realização do investimento, ficando, inclusive, a cargo do próprio investidor procurar aconselhamento financeiro independente quando julgar apropriado. Veja os <a href="https://www.nexoos.com.br/termos-e-condicoes-investidor">Termos e Condições Investidores Nexoos</a> para mais informações em relação às operações disponibilizadas na plataforma Nexoos, seus riscos, os procedimentos e outras questões legais relacionadas aos investimentos.</p>

IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?","Hello, IT. Ya ha? Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?","I'll just put it here with the rest of the fire.","Yes, there is. I am sick of my things going walkabout. With this picture, everyone knows that a certain Mr Moss might be looking for his cup.","Ugh, OK, well the button on the side, is it glowing?... Yeah, you need to turn it on. Erm, the button turns it on. Yeah, you... you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes.","See. the driver hooks the function by patching the system call table, so it's not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory... Hello?","An ill wind is blowing. Last night I was stirred from my slumber by a crow calling three times. Caw... caw... well you know what a crow sounds like. Passing to my window, I trod on a piece of lego. Oh, it went right in the heel. Turning on my television set, I noticed the reception wasn't great. Not terrible, just not great. Hear me well, no good can come of your trip to the theatre tonight, no good at all. And if you ask me... That's just bloody rude. Where's my Heat?","I don't know if it's the loss of blood or the melting plastic from the monitor, but I feel great!","Didn't know what a stress machine as this morning, and now we have two of them.","Now, let's see what we have here. 'Stand upright.' Well now I can't read it. Oh, not me. I AM a giddy goat.","Jen, if this needle goes past here, you're fired. Does that make you feel stressed at all? Does it? Jen? Are you sure? Jen? Does it? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure?","I used to work as a waiter. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers.","Would I blow everyone's mind if I ate dessert first?","It's a bucket of fried chicken. And it comes in a real bucket.","Yes, I believe it was Tolstoy who said... Oh, it appears we have a visitor. I'm sorry, myself and Maurice were engaged in quite a serious discussion about books and such. We didn't hear you come in.","Why are you speaking in that weird voice? When did...? I don't remember this conversation AT ALL.","There's nothing sexual about it, I mean I like Roy, but I'm not 'Curious'.","So, what brings you to my lair? Not that I'm some sort of animal. Or, or maybe I am.","Oh look, Richmond's still alive.","My middle name is ready. No, that doesn't sound right. I eat ready for breakfast.","Fire. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road... no, that's too formal. Fire - exclamation mark - fire - exclamation mark - help me - exclamation mark. 123 Cavendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours truly, Maurice Moss.","I don't like goat's anything. I don't like goats being involved in any stage of the food production process.","This flipping circuit board, Jen. Some chump has run the data lines right through the power supply. Amateur hour! I've got tears in my eyes!","They're fairly regular the beatings, yes. I'd say we're on a Bi-weekly beating","OK, lady! You've won this round! But we can wait. You will slip up one day. And believe you me, we will be there when you do. There will be some piece of evidence that will prove without any shadow of a doubt that you don't know anything about computers!","Team! Team, team, team, team, team! I even love saying the word 'team'. You probably think that's a picture of my family. Uh uh. It's the A-Team! Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man.","Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?","Oh, it's just water. Sometimes I get a hot ear, and this helps cool it down. She is quite the oddball.","I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen, but I find the best thing to do with a new employee is to size them up with a long, hard stare...","That's the sort of place this is, Jen. A lot of sexy people, not doing much work and having affairs!","Well, don't take this the wrong way, but could he have thought you were a man?","Ah! The IT-department. Run by a dynamic go-getter, a genius and a man from Ireland.","You wouldn't shoot a Policeman and then steal his helmet. You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet, and then send it to the Policeman's grieving widow, and then steal it again. Downloading films is stealing; if you do it you WILL face the consequences!","Ah, well, prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame set at gas mark 'egg on your face'! I sort of forget what I was talking about.","Oh... morning. Oh my word. When did the English start drinking like that? You people drink like you don't want to live.","You best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm going to take them for the ride of their life!","Listen, Alistair, I just wanted to say, I'm not a window cleaner. No, no, I work in IT. Yeah, yeah, with computers and all that. Macs? No, I just really work with Windows. Hello?","I'm a 32 year old IT consultant who works in the basement. Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.","I only know one woman and she just left the room shouting 'The shoes!'","Nice screensaver. I love the way the smoke seems to be coming off the top of it...","A plan. Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.","Hello? What? Well if you can't work as a team you're all fired. That's it, you heard me, fired! Get your things and go. Hello, security? Everyone on floor 4 is fired. Escort them from the premises. And do it as a team. Remember, you're a team and if you can't act as a team, you're fired too. Dom, get on to recruitment. Get them to look for a security team that can work as a team. They may have to escort the current security team from the building for not acting like a team.","Never been. But I've always liked the idea of the theatre. The smell of the grease, the roar of the paint. I've often thought if I hadn't ended up in computers, I would've gone into the theatre.","If this evening is going to work in any way, you need to pretend to be normal people, yeah? Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody. You know, nothing about memory, or RAM.","Roy, I spoke to the Elders of the Internet not one hour ago. I told them about Jen winning Employee of the Month and they were so impressed that they wanted to do whatever they could to help.","Well, I'm the boss... Head Honcho. El Numero Uno. Mr. Big. The Godfather. Lord of the Rings. The Bourne... Identity. Er... Taxi Driver. Jaws. I forgot the question quite a while back. Who are you, again?","Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them! Actually, that doesn't work as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages.","Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she saw this original ZX81?","Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I don't care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!","Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality.","I'm sorry for your loss. Move on.","It's not like you've lost a pen, is it? It's so much worse. Would you like a pen? I have a spare one.","With all due respect John, I am the head of IT and I have it on good authority that if you type 'Google' into Google, you can break the Internet. So please, no one try it, even for a joke. It's not a laughing matter. You can break the Internet.","Even if that were true, it's just not in their nature to learn how to use a ladder! They have wings! When a moth thinks about travelling vertically upwards, a ladder is just the last thing they would think of! Moss, I don't like to be negative about it, but everything you invent is worthless!","You want me to open it. That's why you called me all the way up here, to open your laptop?","Well, if someone called me a 'big, ugly builder', I'd be furious - and not just because I'm actually an IT consultant. Revenge, that would be uppermost on my mind: 'I'm going to wee on everything. I'm going to taint her abode. I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises.'","Just promise me we won't do anything else with them. I want to go back to being weird. I like being weird. Weird is all I've got.

He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg!

Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.","For dessert, we ordered the chocolate drizzled churros and they were delicious too! They even came with some fresh fruit (blueberries and strawberries).","Overall, the evening was a smash and I am so glad there is a new location closer to my office!!","Brand new. Great design. Odd to hear pop music in a Mexican establishment. Music is a bit loud. It should be background.","The chicken nachos were delicious and the atmosphere was great. The frozen margaritas were a little on the weak side. Would probably return for a work happy hour but was pretty disappointed about the lack of free tequila and beer we read about!","The counter is on the left side, and so is the menu. It can get pretty busy with 30 min wait times. I recommend checking the website and see how busy their store is.","They are way understaffed, where the cashier needs to stop taking orders to help pack to-go orders. The line ends up piling up and people are neglected.  Seen this happen multiple times during lunch hours.","This particular location like the many other restaurants down the block has ample seating and a second floor.","I first heard about this place through Instagram post. The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!","Great place to stop in from a chaotic Times Square adventure! The coffee is great, the drinks are creative and the staff is very nice and hospitable. Cant wait to stop in again. Without a doubt 5 stars from me!!","Great lattes and cold drinks as well. Nice to see a place carrying local coffee and products in Times Square! Excited to make it a part of my morning commute as it is much less crowded than the chain coffee shops around here.","Fish was high quality but portions were small. $57 for 9 pieces and a hand roll which is fair but on the expensive side.","Ambience was good, service was no nonsense but friendly.","Id have to say that each piece was fresh and had their own slight unique flavor twist to it, pushing the line between traditional edomae and fusion. The Hokkaido uni and the ocean trout topped with cook seaweed was the highlights of the meal. But each piece served was really something special.","Staff was very accommodating but the chef were no nonsense. The ambiance is clean and tranquil which is perfect if youre looking to have a conversation with a date or a friend.","My only critique would be that the rice could of used more vingaer and for them to use real wasabi. Also the variety of fish in stock wasnt a lot but hopefully that can change over time. The cost justify the quality youre getting. A solid 4 stars.","In terms of omakase, they had a few options but the one we chose was the 87 dollar version which include sashimi and sushi."]},"umphreys_mcgee":{"song":["1000 Places to See Before You Die","10th Grade","13 Days","1348","2nd Self","2x2","40's Theme","930","A Mild Sedative","Ahab","Alex's House","All in Time","All Things Ninja","Amble On","Anchor Drops","Andy's Last Beer","Angular Momentum","Atmosfarag","Attachments","Auf Wiedersehen","August","B.Onion","Baby Honey Sugar Darlin","Bad Friday","Bad Poker","Bathing Digits","Believe the Lie","Blue Echo","Bob","Booth Love","Breaker","Bridgeless","Bright Lights Big City","Bullhead City","Bus Call","Catshot","Cemetery Walk","Cemetery Walk II","Chicago","Conduit","Comma Later","Conduit","Constellations","Crucial Taunt","Cummins Lies","Cut off","Cut the Cable","Day Nurse","Dear Lord","Deeper","Den","Depth Charge","Der Bluten Kat","DeWayne","Dim Sun","Divisions","Domino Theory","Dough Bro","Downtrodden","Draconian","Dream Team","Drink My Drank","Drums","Duck Butter","Dump City","Eat","Educated Guess","Empty the Tank","End of the Road","Example 1","FDR","FF","Final Word","Flamethrower","Fly Like a Beagle","Fool's Gold","Forks","Front Porch","Front Port","Full Frontal","Funk Improv","Funk Jam","G-Song","Gents","Gesture Under a Mitten","Get in the Van","Glory","Go to Hell","Gobbler's Knob","Gone for Good","Goonville","Got Your Milk Right Here","Gravity's Real","Great American","Gulf Stream","Gurgle","Gut Strut","Hajimemashite","Hangover","Headphones & Snowcones","Higgins","Hindsight","Hourglass","Hours","Hurt Bird Bath","In the Black","In the Kitchen","In Violation of Yes","Intentions Clear","JaJunk","Jared","Jekyll & Hyde","Jose","Kabump","Kat's Tune","Keefer","Kimble","Kula","Larceny","Last Call","Last Man Swerving","Le Blitz","Leave Me Las Vegas","Liberty Echo","Lift & Separate","Liquid","Little Gift","Loose Ends","Lord Bail Ship","Lucid State","Mad Love","Made to Measure","Mail Package","Make it Right","Mamu","Mantis","Mantis Ghetts","Memoris of Home","Miami Virtue","Miss Tinkle's Overture","Moogasaurus Rex","Morning Song","Much Obliged","Muff II The Revenge","MuffburgerSandwich","Mulche's Odyssey","Mullet Over","Nachos for Two","Nemo","Never Cease","Night Nurse","Nipple Trix","No Comment","Non-Compliance","Nopener","North Route","Nothing Too Fancy","Ocean Billy","October Rain","Oesque","Onward and Upward","Orfeo","Out of Order","Padgett's Profile","Partyin Peeps","Passing","Pay the Snucka","Phil's Farm","Pick your Nose","Piranhas","Plunger","PonchEstrada","Pooh Doggie","Preamble","Professor Wormbog","Prophecy Now","Proverbial","Prowler","Puppet String","Push the Booth Deeper","Push the Pig","QBert","Raymond","Red Room Disco","Red Tape","Remind Me","Resolution","REW","Ride On Pony","Ringo","Rise To the Top","Rising Bird","Robot World","Rocker","Rocker Part 2","Roctopus","Room To Breathe","Roulette","Salamander Strut","Scaffolding Melee","Search 4","Similar Skin","Skin the Cat","Skip","Slacker","Slow","Sludge and Death","Smell the Mitten","Snake Juice","Sociable Jimmy","Soul Food","Space Funk Booty","Speak Up","Spires","St. Hubbins March 2","Spires","Stanton","Stinko's Ascension","Susanah","Sweetness","Syncopated Strangers","Take it to Church","Tango Mike","The Bottom Half","The Crooked One","The Empire State","The Floor","The Fussy Dutchman","The Fuzz","The Haunt","The Linear","The Other Side of Things","The Pequod","The Plot Thickens","The Triple Wide","The Weight Around","There's No Crying in Mexico","Theresa","Thin Air","Through the Cracks","Tribute to the Spinal Shaft","Turn and Dub","Turn and Run","Uncle Wally","Uncommon","Until We Meet Again","Utopian Fir","Vibe","Visions","Waist Down","Walletsworth","Wappy Sprayberry","Water","Web Tangle","Weed Rap","Wellwishers","White Man's Moccasins","White Pickle","Wife Soup","Wizard Burial Ground","Women Wine and Song","Words","Yoga Pants","You Got the Wrong Guy","Zeroes and Ones"]},"heroes_of_the_storm":{"battlegrounds":["Alterac Pass","Battlefield of Eternity","Blackheart's Bay","Braxis Holdout","Cursed Hollow","Dragon Shire","Garden of Terror","Hanamura Temple","Haunted Mines","Infernal Shrines","Sky Temple","Tomb of the Spider Queen","Towers of Doom","Volskaya Foundry","Warhead Junction"],"classes":["Bruiser","Healer","Melee Assassin","Ranged Assassin","Support","Tank"],"heroes":["Abathur","Alarak","Alexstrasza","Ana","Anduin","Anub'arak","Artanis","Arthas","Auriel","Azmodan","Blaze","Brightwing","Cassia","Chen","Cho","Chromie","D.Va","Deckard","Dehaka","Diablo","E.T.C.","Falstad","Fenix","Gall","Garrosh","Gazlowe","Genji","Greymane","Gul'dan","Hanzo","Illidan","Imperius","Jaina","Johanna","Junkrat","Kael'thas","Kel'Thuzad","Kerrigan","Kharazim","Leoric","Li Li","Li-Ming","Lt.

Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.","I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don't think I'll live much longer and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I'll ever write, and god, I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1985, I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain. My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl's grammar; it was at school that I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful. I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn't. In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents. I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that inch, we are free. I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015 I starred in my first film, 'The Salt Flats'. It was the most important role of my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years of my life. But America's war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London. After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like 'collateral' and 'rendition' became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don't understand it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I've never cried so hard in my life. It wasn't long till they came for me. It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years, I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie","Listen to me, Evey. This may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it. They took your parents from you. They took your brother from you. They put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life. And you believed that was all there was, didn't you? The only thing you had left was your life, but it wasn't, was it? You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still. Try to feel now what you felt then.","My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.","Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.","Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I've witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I've seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.","So I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco. A gesture, they said, of good will. You wanna know what I think? Well, you're listening to my show, so I will assume you do... I think it's high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them. I think its payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago. I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica belongs! Who's with me? Who's bloody with me? Did you like that? USA... Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica, I mean what else can you say? Here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything. And now, 20 years later, is what? The world's biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn't the war they started. It wasn't the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he's not up there? You think he's not watching over this country? How else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through. We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go. Strength through unity. Unity through faith. I'm a God-fearing Englishman and I'm goddamn proud of it!","Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."],"quotes":["A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it.

I don't want this for either of us, but I couldn't see any other way. You were unconscious, and I had to make a decision.

For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.","The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.","I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.","Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.","Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.","You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.","People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.","In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use.","Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.","Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.","Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.","Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming.","I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.","Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.","I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.","Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while I'm not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.","It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but the language should make good looking code possible.","Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.","Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.","Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.","Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait.

A Nexoos disponibiliza, opera e gerencia uma plataforma online que conecta empresas em busca de empréstimos (Mutuários ou Solicitantes) com Investidores.

Este modelo de aproximação entre Empresa Solicitante e Investidor funciona da seguinte forma: uma CCB, documento representativo de uma operação de crédito, é emitida pela Empresa Solicitante em favor da Instituição Financeira Parceira é vinculada a uma série de RDBs, títulos representativos do Investimento feito por cada um dos Investidores, por meio de \"Operações Ativas Vinculadas\", conforme Resolução nº. 2.921, de 17 de janeiro de 2002, do Conselho Monetário Nacional.","line3":"2.3. Cada operação de crédito é formalizada mediante a emissão de CCBs pela Empresa Solicitante em favor da Instituição Financeira Parceira.

Caso haja um conflito entre estes Termos e Condições e os termos e condições da CCB, os termos da CCB sempre devem prevalecer.","line4":"2.4.

O RDB será sempre de propriedade do Investidor. Caso haja um conflito entre estes Termos e Condições e os termos e condições do RDB, os termos do RDB sempre devem prevalecer.","line5":"2.5. Pelo fato de serem Operações Ativas Vinculadas, as operações de crédito e investimento realizadas na Plataforma vinculam diretamente o crédito tomado pelo Solicitante formalizado via CCB e o Investimento feito pelo Investidor na forma de um RDB, conforme acima explicado. Dessa forma, o produto ou resultado do Investimento (bem como a devolução do valor principal desembolsado pelo Investidor ao Mutuário) está 100% (cem por cento) atrelado ao pagamento das parcelas do empréstimo tomado pelo Mutuário objeto da referida CCB."}},"become_nexoos_investor":{"title":"<b>3.
